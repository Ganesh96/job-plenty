## How to Manage Job Entries

Job entries in this table are managed by creating GitHub Issues using the **Job Opportunities Portal** application. Collaborators are responsible for applying these changes to the `README.md` file after verification.

### 1. Add a New Job Entry

When you create an "Add Job" issue via the application, it will generate markdown for a new table row.

**Example of "Add Job" Issue Content:**

### New Job Opportunity Request: [Suggested JPID]

**Company Name:** [Company]  
**Position Name:** [Position]  
**Job Link:** [Link]  
**Suggested JPID:** [Suggested JPID]

---
*This issue was created via the Job Opportunities Portal application.*  
*Note: The suggested JPID is a client-side counter. A collaborator should verify this information and assign the final unique ID when adding it to the `readme.md` file.*
